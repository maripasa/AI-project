Welcome to the **PatternExtractor** project, organized by **Professor Daniel Ferreira at IFCE**.

## Overview
The **PatternExtractor** project is a part of the Programming Lab for the second semester of 2023. The goal of this project is to develop an AI-based solution for extracting and analyzing patterns from datasets.

# Project Description
## Purpose
The primary objective of **PatternExtractor** is to create a tool that can automatically identify and extract meaningful patterns from medical datasets.

## Technologies
> **Note:** Although great accuracy is encouraged, we won't be avaliated in the "AI part of the code".
We will be using mainly C and Weka.

Weka is an open-source software suite designed for data mining and machine learning tasks developed at the University of Waikato, New Zealand.
