# PatternExtractor - Programming Lab 2023-2

_Read this in other languages: [English](README.en.md), [PortuguÃªs](README.md)._

Welcome to the **PatternExtractor** project, organized by **Professor Daniel Ferreira at IFCE**.

## Overview
The **PatternExtractor** project is a part of the Programming Lab for the second semester of 2023. The goal of this project is to develop an AI-based solution for extracting and analyzing patterns from datasets.

## Purpose
The primary objective of **PatternExtractor** is to create a tool that can automatically identify and extract meaningful patterns from medical datasets.

## Technologies
> **Note:** Although great accuracy is encouraged, we won't be avaliated in the "AI part of the code".
We will be using mainly C and Weka.

Weka is an open-source software suite designed for data mining and machine learning tasks developed at the University of Waikato, New Zealand.

## Code Execution

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following prerequisites installed on your system:

- Linux is recommended.

### Running the Code

Follow these steps to execute the code:

- **Step 1:** Clone the repository to your local machine.

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/maripasa/PatternExtractor.git
    ```

- **Step 2:** Navigate to the project directory.

    ```bash
    cd PatternExtractor
    ```
   
- **Step 3:** Run the program.

    ```bash
    # Example command to run SCM_Extractor
    ./bin/SCM_Extractor.exe <CursorFilterSize> <QuantizationLevels> <InputDirectory> <OutputDirectory>
    ```

### Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues during execution, consider the following:

- Recompile using Makefile for maximum compatibility.

    For Unix:
    ```bash
    make clean-unix
    make
    ```
    For Windows:
    ```bash
    make clean-windows
    make
    ```
